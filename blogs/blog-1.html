                Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an important part of our everyday life, even if we are not
                always
                aware of it. AI is used in many applications we use daily, such as smartphones, social media, and online
                shopping platforms.

                For example, voice assistants like Siri or Google Assistant use AI to understand and respond to user
                commands. Recommendation systems on platforms like YouTube, Netflix, and Instagram analyze our behavior
                to
                suggest content we might like. AI is also used in navigation apps, facial recognition, and smart home
                devices.

                The use of AI makes everyday tasks easier, faster, and more efficient. As technology continues to
                develop,
                AI will play an even bigger role in improving our daily lives.
