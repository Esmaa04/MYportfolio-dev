            <h1>High School Graduation Project - Quadrilaterals</h1>
            <br>
            <p>This project explores quadrilaterals in geometry, including squares, rectangles, trapezoids, and
                rhombuses.
                The study includes detailed diagrams, calculations of angles and sides, as well as practical
                applications in architecture and design.
                The aim was to understand the properties of quadrilaterals and demonstrate their real-life significance.
