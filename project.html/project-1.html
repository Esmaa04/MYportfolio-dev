                <p>
                    This project represents my first independent HTML website, created during
                    the <strong>HTML & CSS course at King Fahd Cultural Center</strong>.
                    As part of the final course exam, I was required to design and build a
                    complete static webpage from scratch using only HTML and CSS.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The goal of this project was to demonstrate my understanding of basic web
                    structure, semantic HTML elements, layout organization, and CSS styling.
                    I focused on creating a clean and well-structured page, applying fundamental
                    concepts such as typography, colors, spacing, and alignment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in writing semantic HTML,
                    styling layouts using CSS, and structuring content for readability and usability.
                    This project marks an important milestone in my journey into web development,
                    as it was my first fully independent website.
                </p>
