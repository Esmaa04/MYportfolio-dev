            Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, networks, and data from digital attacks. These
            attacks can include hacking, data theft, viruses, and unauthorized access to personal information.

            In today’s digital world, people store a lot of sensitive data online, such as passwords, personal details,
            and financial information. Cybersecurity helps keep this data safe and prevents misuse.

            Cyber attacks can affect individuals, companies, and even governments. A single security breach can cause
            financial loss, damage reputation, and lead to serious consequences.

            That is why cybersecurity is very important. Using strong passwords, updating software regularly, and being
            cautious online are simple but effective ways to improve digital security.
