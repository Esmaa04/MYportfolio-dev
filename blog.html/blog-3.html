                Frontend development is a part of web development that focuses on everything users see and interact with
                on a website or application. It includes the design, layout, and behavior of elements such as buttons,
                navigation menus, images, text, and forms.

                Frontend developers use technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build responsive and visually
                appealing interfaces. HTML is used to structure the content, CSS is responsible for styling and layout,
                while JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic features.

                The main goal of frontend development is to create a good user experience. A well-designed frontend
                makes a website easy to use, accessible, and visually attractive on different devices such as computers,
                tablets, and mobile phones.
